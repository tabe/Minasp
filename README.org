#+TITLE: Minasp: a Nix package of Mew

* Abstract
Minasp ("Mew is Not A Single Program") is a [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] package of [[https://www.mew.org/][Mew]], using [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs][nixpkgs]].
This package installs a latest Mew's Emacs Lisp program as well as utility programs constituting
the MUA, e.g. =mewl=, which [[https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/Mew/issues/138][are ommitted when installing MELPA's Mew package]].

* Usage
Installing Mew by Minasp is easy.
All you have to do is to enable a couple of packages defined in [[file:minasp.nix]] with =nixpkgs=' =callPackage=.
They are named =minasp.elisp= and =minasp.utils=. The former is the Elisp part while the latter
consists of the accompanying utility programs.
Some examples of their usage are given as follows.

** With Home Manager
A minimal configuration in =~/.config/home-manager/home.nix= for making Mew available:
#+begin_src nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: let

  minasp = pkgs.callPackage ./minasp.nix {};

in {

  home.packages = [
    minasp.utils
    pkgs.stunnel
  ];

  programs.emacs = {
    enable = true;
    extraPackages = epkgs: [
      minasp.elisp
    ];
  };

}
#+end_src
